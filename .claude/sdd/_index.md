# AgentSpec

> 5-phase development workflow with Agent Matching and Delegation, specialized for Data Engineering.
> *"Brainstorm -> Define -> Design -> Build -> Ship"*

---

## Overview

AgentSpec provides Agent Matching (Design phase) and Agent Delegation (Build phase):

| Traditional Approach | AgentSpec |
|---------------|--------------|
| 8 phases | **5 phases** (Brainstorm optional) |
| 3 development modes | **1 unified stream** |
| Generic agents only | **58 specialized agents** across 8 categories |
| No domain expertise | **24 KB domains** for data engineering |
| 12+ commands | **31 commands** (7 SDD + 8 DE + 8 visual + 5 core + 2 review + 1 knowledge) |
| 11+ artifact types | **5 artifact types** |
| Separate ADR files | **Inline decisions** |
| Pre-generated tasks | **On-the-fly execution** |

## Quick Start

### Data Engineering Feature (Full Pipeline)

```bash
# Phase 0: Explore the idea (optional)
/brainstorm "Build an incremental orders pipeline with SCD Type 2"

# Phase 1: Define requirements (from brainstorm output)
/define .claude/sdd/features/BRAINSTORM_ORDERS_PIPELINE.md

# Phase 2: Create technical design
/design .claude/sdd/features/DEFINE_ORDERS_PIPELINE.md

# Phase 3: Build the code
/build .claude/sdd/features/DESIGN_ORDERS_PIPELINE.md

# Phase 4: Archive when complete
/ship .claude/sdd/features/DEFINE_ORDERS_PIPELINE.md
```

### DE-Specific Commands (Skip SDD)

```bash
# Design a star schema
/schema "Star schema for e-commerce analytics"

# Scaffold a pipeline
/pipeline "Daily orders ETL from Postgres to Snowflake"

# Generate quality checks
/data-quality models/staging/stg_orders.sql
```

### Making Changes Mid-Stream

```bash
# Update DEFINE with new requirement
/iterate DEFINE_ORDERS_PIPELINE.md "Add support for late-arriving facts"

# Update DESIGN with architecture change
/iterate DESIGN_ORDERS_PIPELINE.md "Switch to incremental strategy"
```

## Phase Details

> Summaries only — each phase's full methodology lives in its `sdd-<phase>` skill; contract-grade facts live in `architecture/WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml`.

### Phase 0: Brainstorm (Optional)

**Purpose:** Explore ideas through collaborative dialogue before capturing requirements.

**When to Use:**
- Vague idea that needs exploration
- Multiple possible approaches to consider
- Uncertain about scope or users
- Need to apply YAGNI before diving in

**When to Skip:**
- Clear requirements already known
- Meeting notes with explicit asks
- Simple feature request

**Input:** Raw idea, problem statement, or vague request.

**Output:** `BRAINSTORM_{FEATURE}.md` with:
- Discovery questions and answers
- 2-3 approaches explored with trade-offs
- Selected approach with reasoning
- Features removed (YAGNI applied)
- Draft requirements for /define

**Quality Gate:** Min 3 questions, 2+ approaches, 2+ validations, user confirmed

### Phase 1: Define

**Purpose:** Capture and validate requirements from any input.

**Input:** BRAINSTORM document, raw notes, emails, conversations, or direct requirements.

**Output:** `DEFINE_{FEATURE}.md` with:
- Problem statement
- Target users
- Success criteria (measurable)
- Acceptance tests (Given/When/Then)
- Technical Context (deployment location, KB domains, data lineage)
- Out of scope

**Quality Gate:** Clarity Score >= 12/15

### Phase 2: Design

**Purpose:** Create complete technical design with inline decisions.

**Input:** `DEFINE_{FEATURE}.md`

**Output:** `DESIGN_{FEATURE}.md` with:
- Architecture diagram (ASCII)
- Key decisions with rationale
- File manifest with agent assignments
- Code patterns (copy-paste ready)
- Testing strategy

**Quality Gate:** Complete file manifest, all files have agents, no shared dependencies

### Phase 3: Build

**Purpose:** Execute implementation following the design with agent delegation.

**Input:** `DESIGN_{FEATURE}.md`

**Output:**
- Code files (as specified in manifest)
- `BUILD_REPORT_{FEATURE}.md` with agent attribution

**Quality Gate:** All tasks complete, all tests pass

### Phase 4: Ship

**Purpose:** Archive completed feature with lessons learned.

**Input:** All feature artifacts

**Output:**
- `archive/{FEATURE}/` folder with all documents
- `SHIPPED_{DATE}.md` with lessons learned

## Key Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Single Stream** | No mode switching, one unified workflow |
| **Inline Decisions** | ADRs in DESIGN document, not separate files |
| **On-the-Fly Tasks** | Tasks generated from file manifest during build |
| **Self-Contained** | Each deployable unit works independently |
| **Config Over Code** | Use YAML for configuration, not hardcoded values |
| **Iterate Anywhere** | Changes can be made at any phase via `/iterate` |
| **Data Engineering First** | Pipelines, schemas, and quality are built-in concerns |

---

## Model Assignment

Per-agent model tiers live in each agent's frontmatter (authoritative), mirrored into `routing.json` at build time — this index no longer restates them (a previous copy here had drifted).
