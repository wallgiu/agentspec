### Repo-Local Skills (not distributed)

These skills support contributors working in this repository and are excluded from the distributed plugin (`REPO_LOCAL_SKILLS` in `build-plugin.sh`).

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `create-skill` | This repository's conventions for adding a skill — naming, placement tiers, frontmatter pitfalls, ship checklist; defers general skill-writing craft to the upstream `skill-creator` |
| `create-agent` | This repository's conventions for adding an agent — the frontmatter contract (router-feeding fields), thin-executor default, router regeneration, ship checklist |
| `meeting-analysis` | Turns a meeting transcript into a validated analysis document (via `meeting-analyst`) plus a channel-ready follow-up message |
| `standup-report` | Daily standup message (Done / Will do / Blockers) assembled from git history, PRs/issues, and user input |

### Plugin-Only Skills

These skills are bundled in the distributed plugin (`plugin/skills/`) at build time but do not live in the `.claude/` source tree. They are merged in by `build-plugin.sh` from `plugin-extras/skills/`.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `data-engineering-guide` | Data engineering expertise for pipelines, schemas, data quality, SQL, lakehouse, and streaming. Routes users to the right command and agent based on their task, backed by 24 KB domains. |

(`sdd-workflow` moved from plugin-only into the `.claude/skills/` source tree alongside the per-phase `sdd-*` skills it indexes.)

## Configuration

### Workflow Contracts

Phase transition rules are defined in `.claude/sdd/architecture/WORKFLOW_CONTRACTS.yaml`:

- Phase inputs, outputs, and quality gates
- Model allocation per phase (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- Naming conventions (`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`)
- Cascade rules for `/iterate`
- Status transition logic
- Data engineering delegation map and quality gates
- Data anti-patterns checklist

### Settings

Project settings in `.claude/settings.local.json` (auto-generated, gitignored — personal to each developer):

- `permissions` — tool access control
- `outputStyle` — response formatting (e.g., "Explanatory")

---

## File Naming Conventions

| Artifact | Pattern | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Brainstorm document | `BRAINSTORM_{FEATURE}.md` | `.claude/sdd/features/` |
| Requirements document | `DEFINE_{FEATURE}.md` | `.claude/sdd/features/` |
| Design document | `DESIGN_{FEATURE}.md` | `.claude/sdd/features/` |
| Build report | `BUILD_REPORT_{FEATURE}.md` | `.claude/sdd/reports/` |
| Shipped archive | `SHIPPED_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` | `.claude/sdd/archive/{FEATURE}/` |

Feature names use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `ORDERS_PIPELINE`, `STAR_SCHEMA`).
